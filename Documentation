Lessons Learned:

We learned, that splitting up the functionality of the singular services made the service easier to manipulate and maintain. Making changes and testing was much easier after refactoring some of the code.

Unit Testing Decisions:

We Decided to test simple cases in the Data Collection Dispatcher as well as the main functions in the other services. We also created a test for the PDF Generation.

Total time spent estimate:

25hrs
